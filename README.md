## 🗄️ Database Architecture

Built on **PostgreSQL** via Supabase with comprehensive **Row-Level Security (RLS)** policies.

### Core Tables

| Table | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `profiles` | User accounts | Four roles: instructor, dancer, guardian, admin |
| `students` | Dancer profiles | Can exist independently or link to dancer profiles |
| `classes` | Class sessions | Support for public classes, external booking URLs |
| `enrollments` | Class registration | Links students to classes with attendance tracking |
| `notes` | Progress feedback | Rich text with visibility controls |
| `payments` | Transaction history | Supports 4 pricing models with automatic calculations |
| `waivers` | Digital waivers | Template-based with e-signature capture |
| `waiver_templates` | Reusable waivers | Rich text or PDF format with variable substitution |
| `studios` | Studio locations | Google Places integration for addresses |
| `private_lesson_requests` | Lesson booking | Status tracking and instructor responses |

### Security Model

- **Three-Layer Protection**: Middleware proxy → API route guards → RLS policies
- **Data Isolation**: Instructors only see their students, dancers only see their own data
- **Admin Override**: Admin role can access all portals with most RLS bypasses
- **XSS Prevention**: All user-generated HTML sanitized via DOMPurify

See [SECURITY_FIXES.md](./SECURITY_FIXES.md) and [supabase-RLS.md](./supabase-RLS.md) for details.
