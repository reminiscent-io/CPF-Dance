                <p>
                  The Service is intended for individuals who are at least 13 years old or the age of digital consent in their jurisdiction. Individuals under 13 may not create an account or provide personal information directly through the Service. Instead, a parent or legal guardian must create and manage the account on the minor's behalf and consent to the minor's use of the Service. During signup, users will be asked to confirm that they are at least 13; if they indicate they are under 13, a parent or legal guardian must complete account creation and confirm access for the minor.

                  Where a minor participates in classes or lessons, the parent or legal guardian is the "account holder" and is responsible for: (a) ensuring the minor's compliance with these Terms; (b) any information provided about the minor; and (c) all bookings, payments, and communications related to the minor's use of the Service. If it is discovered that a child under 13 has created an account or provided personal information without verifiable parental consent, the Company may suspend or delete the account and take reasonable steps to remove the related personal information from its systems.
