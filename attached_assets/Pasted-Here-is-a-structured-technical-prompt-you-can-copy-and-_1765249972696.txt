Here is a structured, technical prompt you can copy and paste directly to your AI coder (like Cursor, Replit, or ChatGPT).
It focuses on switching the layout logic based on screen size, which is the standard way to fix "funky" mobile calendars.
Copy and Paste this Prompt:
Context:
I am updating the Instructor Schedule page in my React application. Currently, the calendar component attempts to render a full 7-day horizontal grid on mobile, which results in squished columns and unreadable text.
The Goal:
I need to refactor this page to be responsive. It should keep the grid view on Desktop but switch to a "Vertical Agenda/List View" on Mobile.
Please implement the following changes:
1. Layout Logic (Responsive Breakpoint):
 * Desktop: Keep the current weekly grid view (7 columns).
 * Mobile: Switch to a vertical list view.
   * Group the data by Day (e.g., "Monday, Dec 8").
   * Under each Day header, list the classes chronologically as individual cards/rows.
   * If a day has no classes, you can either hide the day or show "No classes scheduled."
2. Visual Styling (Mobile Only):
 * Remove the Container: On mobile, remove the white card container (box-shadow and padding) that wraps the calendar. The list should span the full width of the screen (edge-to-edge) for a cleaner, native app feel.
 * Class Cards: Design the individual class items in the list to show:
   * Time: (e.g., 4:00 PM) on the left.
   * Details: (Class Name, Studio) on the right.
   * Ensure the typography matches the current serif font used for headers.
3. "Manage Classes" Button:
 * The current "Manage Classes" button takes up too much vertical space at the top.
 * Please move this button to be a sticky Floating Action Button (FAB) in the bottom-right corner, OR make it a smaller secondary outline button next to the "My Schedule" header.
Tech Stack Note:
 * Use the existing theme colors (Mauve/Dusty Rose) for the headers and accents.
 * Ensure the date navigation (Next/Prev/Today) remains accessible at the top.
Why this prompt works:
 * It defines the "Responsive Breakpoint": It tells the AI that you don't want to destroy the desktop view (which probably looks fine), you only want to change the Mobile view.
 * It specifies the "Agenda" pattern: "Vertical Agenda View" is a specific UI term that AI coding tools understand well. It knows this means "Stack days on top of each other."
 * It addresses the "Edge-to-Edge" look: By asking to remove the container on mobile, you get that sleek, modern look where the content touches the sides of the phone, maximizing space.
