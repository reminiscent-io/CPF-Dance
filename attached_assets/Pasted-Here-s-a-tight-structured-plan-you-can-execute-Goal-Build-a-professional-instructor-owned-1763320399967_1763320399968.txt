Here’s a tight, structured plan you can execute.

# Goal

Build a professional, instructor-owned app that proves dancer progress, reduces scheduling friction, and turns structured feedback into private-lesson and studio re-bookings.

# Users & core value

* Students & guardians – see progress, notes, schedules, easy pay.
* Studios – simple confirmations, history, analytics proof of outcomes.
* You – one console for notes, travel-aware schedule, and reconciled payments.

# Phase 0 – Foundations (week 0–1)

* Tech setup – Next.js App Router, Postgres + Prisma, Tailwind tokens, auth with phone OTP + passkey fallback.
* Data models – users, students, studios, classes, enrollments, notes, payments, payment_events.
* CI/CD – Vercel deploy, environment secrets, error logging.

# Phase 1 – MVP features (weeks 1–4)

1. Auth & profiles

   * Phone OTP sign-in, guardian consent gate for U13, basic profile edit.

2. Notes & timeline

   * Instructor adds tagged notes per student (shared or private).
   * Student can add personal notes.
   * Timeline view with filters by tag.

3. Scheduling basics

   * Create classes with studio location.
   * Student portal shows “My classes.”
   * Private-lesson request form.

4. Payments v1

   * Stripe Payment Link checkout for private lessons.
   * Cash/check entries with dual-confirmation states.
   * Receipts and basic ledger per student/studio.

5. Studio inquiry

   * Public form → creates lead → email alert to you.

Success criteria

* 1 studio pilot using the portal; 20 students onboarded.
* ≥ 70% of sessions receive at least one instructor note.
* ≥ 60% calendar feed adoption.
* ≥ 60% of transactions auto-confirm via Stripe or Tap to Pay.

# Phase 2 – Operations & trust (weeks 5–7)

* Travel-aware checks – drive-time + buffer warnings on save.
* Payment queue – inbox for “awaiting your action” vs “awaiting studio.”
* Studio portal – submit cash/check, view history, download CSV.
* Progress report PDF – per student per term with branded styling.

Success criteria

* Late or disputed payments ≤ 5% by count.
* 1 in 3 progress reports triggers a private-lesson inquiry.

# Phase 3 – Growth levers (weeks 8–10)

* Analytics – skill radar, attendance, income by class, payment aging.
* Marketing pages – SEO studio pages and master-class landing with form.
* Referral nudges – shareable badges and “book a focus session” CTA.
* Subscriptions & packs – prepaid packs and studio retainers.

Success criteria

* Studio re-booking rate ≥ 60% within 45 days.
* Private-lesson uplift ≥ 15% after analytics + reports launch.

# Phase 4 – Hardening (weeks 11–12)

* Access control – RLS, event logs for payments/notes, admin audit.
* Performance – cache routes, ISR for public pages, P95 API ≤ 300 ms.
* Accessibility – WCAG AA sweep; visible focus and contrast checks.

# What not to build yet

* Full social features, complex gamification, or multi-instructor marketplace. Stay focused on progress proof, scheduling reliability, and clean reconciliation.

# Minimal stack choices

* Next.js + Route Handlers, Postgres (Neon or Supabase), Prisma, Stripe (Checkout + Tap to Pay), Twilio SMS, Tailwind design tokens, Recharts for simple charts.
