2. Information We Collect
We collect the following categories of information, depending on how you use the Service:​

Account and Profile Information: Name, email address, phone number, password, and optional profile details (such as preferences, notes relevant to lessons, or studio affiliation).

Student / Guardian Information: For minors, we may collect the student’s name, age or date of birth, and lesson history, along with the parent or legal guardian’s contact information and relationship to the student.​

Scheduling and Usage Data: Booked classes and lessons, attendance, studio affiliations, communications with instructors or studios, and other Service usage information.

Technical Information: IP address, browser type, device identifiers, pages viewed, and similar usage data collected through server logs and, when implemented, cookies and analytics tools such as Google Analytics.​

You may choose not to provide certain information, but this may limit your ability to use some features of the Service.

3. How We Collect Information
We collect information in several ways:​

Directly from You: When you create an account, complete a profile, book or manage lessons, send messages, or contact support.

From Parents/Guardians or Studios: When a parent or guardian registers a minor, or when a studio or instructor adds information needed to manage classes and lessons for you or your child.​

Automatically: Through server logs and similar technologies when you access the Service, and through cookies and analytics tools once implemented.

From Third Parties: From payment processors, and, if enabled in future, from analytics or communication tools integrated with the Service.

4. How We Use Information
We use personal information for the following purposes:​

Providing and Operating the Service: Creating and managing accounts, scheduling and managing classes and private lessons, and enabling two‑way communication between students, parents, instructors, and studios.

Payments and Billing: Processing payments, issuing refunds when applicable, and maintaining transaction records through third‑party payment providers.

Communication: Sending confirmations, reminders, updates about lessons or schedules, and responding to inquiries.

Safety and Compliance: Enforcing our Terms of Service, managing age‑based access (including under‑13 restrictions), and complying with legal obligations.

Improvement and Analytics: Monitoring usage trends, troubleshooting technical issues, and improving the functionality, performance, and user experience of the Service.

Marketing (Limited): With any required consent, informing you about new features, services, or updates related to the platform; you can opt out of most marketing communications at any time.

We do not sell your personal information.

5. Children and Minors
Our Service is intended for individuals 13 years and older, with special handling for minors:​

Children Under 13: Children under 13 may not create accounts or provide information directly. A parent or legal guardian must create and manage the account on the child’s behalf and consent to the child’s participation in lessons managed through the Service.

Parental Accounts: When a parent or guardian creates an account for a minor, we treat the parent/guardian as the account holder and collect only the information reasonably necessary to manage lessons, scheduling, and related communications.​

Inadvertent Collection: If we learn that we have collected personal information directly from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete such information or obtain consent promptly.​

If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13 in a manner inconsistent with this Policy, please contact us using the information above.

6. Legal Bases and Consent (If Applicable)
Where required by law (for example, in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.), we rely on one or more of the following legal bases to process personal data:​

Performance of a contract (providing the Service you request).

Legitimate interests (such as securing and improving the Service, preventing misuse, and communicating essential information).

Compliance with a legal obligation (such as record‑keeping or responding to lawful requests).

Consent (such as certain marketing or children’s data practices where required).

Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw consent at any time, but this will not affect prior processing.

7. How We Share Information
We may share personal information with:​

Instructors and Studios: To the extent necessary for them to manage lessons, attendance, and related communications with you or your child.

Service Providers: Third‑party vendors that help us operate the Service, such as hosting providers (e.g., Supabase), payment processors, email and notification services, and analytics tools (like Google Analytics once implemented).

Legal and Safety Recipients: Law enforcement, regulators, or other parties when required by law, legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, users, or others.

Business Transfers: In connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of all or part of our business, personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to appropriate protections.

We do not sell personal information, and we do not share it with third parties for their independent marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

You can typically control cookies through your browser settings and, where required, through consent banners or preference tools we provide. Disabling certain cookies may affect the functionality of the Service.

9. Data Storage, Security, and Retention
Storage: Data is stored using secure third‑party infrastructure providers, including database services (such as Supabase) selected by the Company.​

Security Measures: We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards intended to protect personal information against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. No system, however, can be guaranteed 100% secure.

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, which may include:​

Accessing a copy of the personal information we hold about you.

Requesting correction of inaccurate or incomplete information.

Requesting deletion of your information, subject to legal or contractual requirements.

Objecting to or restricting certain types of processing.
