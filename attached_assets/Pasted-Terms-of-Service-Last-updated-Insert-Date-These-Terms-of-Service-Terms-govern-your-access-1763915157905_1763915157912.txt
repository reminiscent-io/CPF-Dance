Terms of Service
Last updated: [Insert Date]

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the website, platform, and related services (collectively, the “Service”) provided by Reminiscent Technologies LLC (“Company,” “we,” or “us”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

1. Eligibility and Accounts
1.1 Age Requirements; Children Under 13
The Service is intended for individuals who are at least 13 years old or the age of digital consent in their jurisdiction. Individuals under 13 may not create an account or provide personal information directly through the Service. Instead, a parent or legal guardian must create and manage the account on the minor’s behalf and consent to the minor’s use of the Service. During signup, users will be asked to confirm that they are at least 13; if they indicate they are under 13, a parent or legal guardian must complete account creation and confirm access for the minor.

1.2 Parental / Guardian Accounts for Minors
Where a minor participates in classes or lessons, the parent or legal guardian is the “account holder” and is responsible for: (a) ensuring the minor’s compliance with these Terms; (b) any information provided about the minor; and (c) all bookings, payments, and communications related to the minor’s use of the Service. If it is discovered that a child under 13 has created an account or provided personal information without verifiable parental consent, the Company may suspend or delete the account and take reasonable steps to remove the related personal information from its systems.

1.3 Account Registration
To use certain features (including scheduling, payments, and messaging), you must create an account and provide accurate, current, and complete information, including your name, email address, phone number, and any other requested information. You agree to promptly update this information as needed so it remains accurate.

1.4 Account Security
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify the Company promptly of any unauthorized access or use of your account or other security breaches. The Company is not liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your account.

The Company may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part or all of the Service at any time, with or without notice, including for maintenance, upgrades, or other operational reasons. The Company will not be liable if any part of the Service is unavailable at any time or for any period.
